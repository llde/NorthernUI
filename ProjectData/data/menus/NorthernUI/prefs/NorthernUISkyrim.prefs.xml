      HUD SCALING OPTIONS
      
      Current design is for "100%" in these options to line up to 
      the scaling values that we were using before we implemented 
      these. Many of NorthernUI's graphics were designed at higher 
      resolutions than they are displayed at, and the menu XML was 
      set up to downscale them. As an example, the compass was set 
      to display at 58% of the texture file's actual size.
      
      So, the compass XML is now set to translate 100% scale from 
      here to 58% "effective" scale. Basically all of these options 
      work the same way, normalizing 100% to the scaling we were 
      using before.
